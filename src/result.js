    'System message: You are tasked with updating a Java class. A minor change is required in the \'ExerciseController\' class to improve its functionality.\n        After making the change, take the complete java class\n        and write it down in the format below:\n        \n        Task: In the \'getExercise\' method of the \'ExerciseController\' class, add a log statement to print "Exercise generated successfully" right after the \'ExerciseResponseTO\' object is created.\n        Ensure the log level is set to \'info\'.\n        \n        result: ```fully_updated_class```\n\n        Remember to include all imports, annotations,\n        and class definitions in the updated class code.\n        \n        The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}\nthe object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{"properties": {"result": {"title": "Result", "description": "The complete Java class code as a string.", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["result"]}\n```\n        ',
