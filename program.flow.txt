Current Flow of the main() Function
Introduction and Setup:
The program starts with an introduction and prompts the user to either select an existing repository from a local directory or enter a GitHub URL.
Repository Cloning and Forking:
Based on the user's input, the program decides whether to fork and clone the repository or just clone it directly.
API and Conversation Handler Setup:
An OpenAIConversationHandler is initialized using an API key for communicating with OpenAI's model.
Build and Analysis Loop:
The program enters a loop where it handles "generations". Each generation represents a cycle of building the project using Maven, scanning it with SonarQube, and processing the issues identified.
Build Execution: The Maven build is executed inside Docker. If the build fails, the program breaks out of the loop.
SonarQube Scan: A SonarQube scan is initiated, also using Docker. The results are used to fetch issues based on their complexity.
Issue Handling: Depending on the generation, all fetched issues are either processed for the first time or re-evaluated with potential fixes applied in previous generations.
Processing Issues: Issues are loaded, handled, and the results are logged. The program checks if all issues are resolved after each generation and may end if so.
Ending the Process:
After processing all generations and either resolving all issues or failing to build/scan successfully, the program outputs a summary and terminates.
