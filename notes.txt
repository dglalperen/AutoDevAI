Questions:
- Should we use SonarCloud or SonarQube for static code analysis?
- if we use SonarQube, we have to install it on a server, right? Is there a free version?

Java static code analysis metrics:
- Clean Code Attributes
- Software Qualities
- The severity of the software quality

Project Lifecycle:

1. SonarCloud Scan
2. Retrieve the results from SonarCloud
3. Filter the results based on the type of the issue
4. Create a prompt for large language model to solve the issues
5. Implement the solution from the prompt results
6. Run the SonarCloud Scan again

Notes:
- We can use quality gates to define a set of conditions which the project is measured install


- we will have to provide more context about the rule itself (X)
- we will have to test on more repositories ( )
- we will have to maybe run the unit tests too if provided ( )
